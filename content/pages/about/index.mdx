I also work closely with stakeholders and leadership to ensure that our solutions are scalable, secure, and maintainable.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am also a strong communicator and collaborator, with the ability to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams. I am passionate about mentoring and developing the skills of the engineers on my team, and I am always looking for ways to improve the effectiveness of our processes and practices.
